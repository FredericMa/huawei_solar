      ## Relevant debug logs
      
      **You MUST include relevant logfiles to debug your issue.**

      For instance: if the integration does not show up in the `+ Add Integration` list, then add any relevant lines you can find in `/config/home-assistant.log` after a full restart of your Home Assistant instance.

      When you don't find any relevant logs, please increase your logging level and try again. To do this, add the following lines to your `/config/configuration.yaml` and restart HA:

      ```yaml
      logger:
        default: debug
        logs:
          custom_components.huawei_solar: debug
          huawei_solar: debug
          pymodbus: debug # only include this if you're having connectivity issues
      ```
      
      Make sure to check for relevant log lines in the **Full logs**, which you can also find in `/config/home-assistant.log`. Do NOT copy&paste info from the summary that you see when going to `System â†’ Logs`, always push the "Load Full Logs" button and look there.
